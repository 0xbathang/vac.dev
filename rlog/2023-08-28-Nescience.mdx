Nescience is a privacy-first blockchain project that aims to enable private trans- actions and provide a general-purpose execution environment for classical ap- plications. The goals include creating a state separation architecture for pub- lic/private computation, designing a versatile virtual machine based on main- stream instruction sets, creating proofs for private state updates, implement- ing a kernel-based architecture for correct execution of private functions, and implementing core DeFi protocols such as AMMs and staking from a privacy perspective. It intends to create a user experience that is similar to public blockchains, but with additional privacy features that users can leverage at will. To achieve this goal, Nescience will implement a versatile virtual machine that can be used to implement existing blockchain applications, while also enabling the development of privacy-centric protocols such as private staking and private DEXs.
To ensure minimal trust assumptions and prevent information leakage, Ne- science proposes a proof system that allows users to create proofs for private state updates, while the verification of the proofs and execution of the public functions inside the virtual machine can be delegated to an external incentivised prover. It also aims to implement a seamless interaction between public and private state, enabling composability between contracts and private and public functions. Finally, Nescience intends to implement permissive licensing, which means that the source code will be open-source, and developers will be able to use and modify the code without any restriction.
