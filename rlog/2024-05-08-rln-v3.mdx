Improving on the previous version of RLN, by allowing dynamic epoch sizes.

## Introduction

Recommended previous reading: [Strengthening Anonymous DoS Prevention with Rate Limiting Nullifiers in Waku](https://vac.dev/rlog/rln-anonymous-dos-prevention).

The premise of rln-v3 is to have variable message rate per variable epoch,
which can be explained in the following way

**rln-v1:** “Alice can send 1 message per global epoch”

- Practically, this is `1 msg/second`

**rln-v2:** “Alice can send `x` messages per global epoch”

- Practically, this is `x msg/second`

**rln-v3:** “Alice can send `x` messages within a time interval `y` chosen by herself.
The funds she has to pay are affected by both the number of messages and the chosen time-interval.
Other participants can chose different time-intervals fitting their specific needs.

- Practically, this is `x msg/y seconds`

What rln-v3 allows is higher flexibility and ease of payment/stake for users who have more predictable usage patterns and therefore,
more predictable bandwidth usage on a p2p network (Waku, etc),
for example -

- an AMM that broadcasts bids, asks and fills over Waku may require a lot of throughput in the smallest epoch possible, and hence may register an rln-v3 membership of `10000 msg/1 second`.
  They could do this with rln-v2 too.
- Alice, a casual user of a messaging app built on Waku, who messages maybe 3-4 people infrequently during the day may register an rln-v3 membership of `100 msg/hour`,
  which would not be possible in rln-v2 considering the `global epoch` was set to `1 second`.
  With rln-v2, Alice would have to register with a membership of `1 msg/sec`,
  which would translate to `3600 msg/hour`,
  which is much higher than the usage she would have, and hence,
  she would have to overpay to stake into the membership set.
- A sync service built over Waku,
  whose spec defines that it MUST broadcast a set of public keys every hour,
  may register an rln-v3 membership of `1 msg/hour`,
  cutting down the costs to enter the membership set earlier.

## Theory

### Modification to leaves set in the Membership Merkle Tree

To ensure that a user’s epoch size(`user_epoch_limit`) is included within their membership we must modify the user’s commitment/leaf in the tree to contain it.
A user’s commitment/leaf in the tree is referred to as a `rate_commitment`,
which was previously derived from their public key (`identity_commitment`),
and their variable message rate (`user_message_limit`).

In **rln-v2:**

$$
rate\_commitment = poseidon([identity\_commitment, user\_message\_limit])
$$

In **rln-v3:**

$$
rate\_commitment = poseidon([identity\_commitment, user\_message\_limit, user\_epoch\_limit])
$$

### Modification to Circuit Inputs

To detect double signaling,
we make use of a circuit output `nullifier`,
which remains the same if a user generates a proof with the same `message_id`, and `external_nullifier`,
where the `external_nullifier` and `nullifier` are defined as below -

$$
external\_nullifier = poseidon([epoch, rln\_identifier]) \\
nullifier = poseidon([identity\_secret, external\_nullifier, message\_id])
$$

Where

- `epoch` is defined as the unix epoch timestamp with seconds precision
- `rln_identifier` uniquely identifies an application for which a user submits a proof
- `identity_secret` is the private key of the user
- `message_id` is the sequence number of the user’s message within `user_message_limit` in an epoch

In rln-v2 the global epoch was 1 second,
hence we did not need to perform any assertions to the epoch’s value inside the circuit,
and the validation of the epoch was handled off-circuit (i.e, too old, too large, bad values etc).

In rln-v3 we propose that the `epoch` that is passed into the circuit,
must be a valid multiple of `user_epoch_limit`,
since the user may pass in values of the `epoch` which do not directly correlate with the `user_epoch_limit`,
for example -

- A user with `user_epoch_limit` of 120,
  passes in an epoch of `237`,
  generates `user_message_limit` proofs with it,
  can increment the epoch by `1`,
  and generate `user_message_limit` proofs with it,
  thereby allowing them to bypass the message per epoch restriction.

One could say that we could perform this validation outside of the circuit,
but we maintain the `user_epoch_limit` as a private input to the circuit so that the user is not deanonymized by the anonymity set connected to that `user_epoch_limit`.
Since `user_epoch_limit` is kept private,
the verifier does not have access to that value and cannot perform validation on it.

If we ensure that the `epoch` is a multiple of `user_epoch_limit`,
we have the following scenarios -

- A user with `user_epoch_limit` of 120,
  passes in an epoch of `237`,
  proof generation fails since epoch is not a multiple of `user_epoch_limit`
- A user with `user_epoch_limit` of 120,
  passes in an epoch of `240`,
  can generate `user_message_limit` proofs without being slashed

Since we perform operations on the `epoch` we must include it as a circuit input which was previously removed from the circuit inputs to rln-v2.
Therefore, the new circuit inputs are as follows -

```c
// unchanged
private identity_secret
private user_message_limit
private message_id
private pathElements[]
private pathIndices[]
public x // messageHash

// new/changed
private user_epoch_limit
private user_epoch_quotient // epoch/user_epoch_limit to assert within circuit
public epoch
public rln_identifier
```

The circuit outputs remain the same.

### Additional Circuit Constraints

1. Since we accept the `epoch`, `user_epoch_quotient` and `user_epoch_limit`,
   we must ensure that the relation between these 3 values is preserved, i.e

   $$
   epoch == user\_epoch\_limit * user\_epoch\_quotient
   $$

2. To ensure no overflows/underflows occur in the above multiplication,
   we must constrain the inputs of `epoch`, `user_epoch_quotient` and `user_epoch_limit`.
   We have assumed `3600` to be the maximum valid size of the `user_epoch_quotient`

$$
size(epoch) \leq 64\ bits \\
size(user\_epoch\_limit) \leq 12\ bits \\
user\_epoch\_limit \leq 3600 \\
user\_epoch\_limit \leq epoch \\
user\_epoch\_quotient < user\_epoch\_limit
$$

### Modifications to external epoch validation (waku, etc)

For receivers of an rln-v3 proof,
to detect if a message is too old we must use the higher bound of the `user_epoch_limit` which has been set to `3600`.
The **trade-off** here is that we allow hour-old messages to propagate within the network.

### Modifications to double signaling detection scheme (waku, etc)

For verifiers of rln-v1/v2 proofs,
a log of nullifiers seen in the last epoch is maintained,
and if there is a match with a pre-existing nullifier,
double signaling has been detected and the verifier MAY proceed to slash the spamming user.

With the rln-v3 scheme,
we need to increase the size of the nullifier log used,
which previously cleared itself every second to the higher bound of the `user_epoch_limit` which is `3600`.
Now, the RLN proof verifier must clear the nullifier log every `3600` seconds to satisfactorily detect double signaling.

It enhances the user's flexibility in setting their message limits and cost-optimizes their stake.
