{"pageProps":{"markdown":{"content":"\n# Overview\n\nVac has several research areas it is interested in and has or is developing expertise in.\nHereâ€™s an overview of some of these areas along with motivation and what type of topics are included.\nNote that a lot of areas are overlapping in terms of specific projects.\n\n## Incentivization\n\nIn an open p2p network, nodes have to be incentivized for services provided to the network.\nAdditionally, these should be privacy-preserving and as trust-minimized as possible.\nThis research area includes (but is not limited to):\nRLN, service credentials, peer reputation, and protocol revenue.\n\n## Applied ZK\n\nApplied ZK opens up the door to many new constructs, especially related to privacy.\nThis research area includes the development of primitives like RLN, Unirep and similar novel constructs,\nbut also research and development related to zero-knowledge technology, such as ZK frameworks like Circom and Halo2, ZK-VM, WASM in the browser, and efficient zk proof systems running on resource-restricted devices.\nDone in close collaboration with other teams in the space.\n\n## Privacy/Anonymity\n\nSpecifically metadata privacy.\nThis includes anonymity studies and providing a modular suite of protocols with clear trade-offs and threat models.\n\n[Privacy/Anonymity Roadmap](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/107)\n\n## Scalability\n\nMaking the network scalable in terms of number of nodes, message rate, discovering of nodes, caching of historical messages etc.\nLargely focused on Waku right now, but things like scalable group chats also relevant here.\n\n## Data synchronization\n\nEnd-to-end data application synchronization protocols, [FT Store](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/21/), interfacing with long-term storage, message bus guarantees,\npossibly [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) etc.\nGuiding principle is to provide additional guarantees for users of Waku (etc) in terms of user experience.\n\n## P2P/Networking\n\nR&D related to P2P protocols and networking, including usage of WebRTC,\nDiscovery for resource-restricted devices,\nand new p2p protocols with different trade-offs.\n\n[Ambient Peer Discovery Roadmap](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/116)\n\n## Censorship resistance\n\nCensorship resistance at all layers of the stack, including obfuscated transports and running in hostile environments.\n\n## Identity/Trust\n\nIdentity and key management required for non-trivial secure messaging.\nThis includes multi device management, group management, trust, and reputation.\nEspecially in a private and secure fashion.\n","metadata":{"title":"Research areas"},"toc":[{"content":"Overview","slug":"overview","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"Incentivization","slug":"incentivization","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Applied ZK","slug":"applied-zk","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"Privacy/Anonymity","slug":"privacy-anonymity","lvl":2,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Scalability","slug":"scalability","lvl":2,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"Data synchronization","slug":"data-synchronization","lvl":2,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"P2P/Networking","slug":"p2p-networking","lvl":2,"i":6,"seen":0},{"content":"Censorship resistance","slug":"censorship-resistance","lvl":2,"i":7,"seen":0},{"content":"Identity/Trust","slug":"identity-trust","lvl":2,"i":8,"seen":0}]},"navProps":{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Research areas"},"navOrder":1682646025.295,"localPath":"research-areas.md","path":["research-areas"],"children":[],"isDir":false},"routeParams":{"path":["research-areas"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
