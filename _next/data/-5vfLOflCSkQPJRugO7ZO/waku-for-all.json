It enables secure, censorship-resistant, privacy-preserving, spam-protected communication for its user.\nIt is designed to run on any device, from mobile to the cloud.\n\nWaku is available on many systems and environments and used by several applications and SDKs for decentralized communications.\n\nThis involved research efforts in various domains: conversational security, protocol incentivization, zero-knowledge,\netc.\n\nWaku uses novel technologies. Hence, we knew that early dogfooding of Waku was necessary. Even if research\nwas still _in progress_ [[1]](#references). Thus, as soon as Waku protocols and software were usable, we started to push\nfor the adoption of Waku. This started back in 2021.\n\nWaku is the communication component of the Web3 trifecta. This trifecta was Ethereum (contracts), Swarm\n(storage) and Whisper (communication). Hence, it made sense to first target dApps which already uses one of the pillars:\nEthereum. \n\nAs most dApps are web apps, we started the development of [js-waku for the browser](https://vac.dev/presenting-js-waku).\n\nOnce ready, we reached out to dApps to integrate Waku, added [prizes to hackathons](https://twitter.com/waku_org/status/1451400128791605254?s=20&t=Zhc0BEz6RVLkE_SeE6UyFA)\nand gave [talks](https://docs.wakuconnect.dev/docs/presentations/).\n\nWe also assumed we would see patterns in the usage of Waku, that we would facilitate with the help of\n[SDKs](https://github.com/status-im/wakuconnect-vote-poll-sdk).\n\nFinally, we created several web apps:\n[examples](https://docs.wakuconnect.dev/docs/examples/)\nand [PoCs](https://github.com/status-iM/gnosis-safe-waku).\n\nBy discussing with Waku users and watching it being used, we learned a few facts:\n\n1. The potential use cases for Waku are varied and many:\n  - Wallet <> dApp communication: [WalletConnect](https://medium.com/walletconnect/walletconnect-v2-0-protocol-whats-new-3243fa80d312), [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/docs/dev-concepts/architectural-overview/)\n  - Off-chain (and private) marketplace:\n    [RAILGUN](https://twitter.com/RAILGUN_Project/status/1556780629848727552?s=20&t=NEKQJiJAfg5WJqvuF-Ym_Q) & \n    [Decentralized Uber](https://twitter.com/TheBojda/status/1455557282318721026)\n  - Signature exchange for a multi-sign wallet: [Gnosis Safe x Waku](https://github.com/status-im/gnosis-safe-waku)\n  - Off-chain Game moves/actions: [Super Card Game (EthOnline 2021)](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline2021/super-card-game)\n  - Decentralized Pastebin: [Debin](https://debin.io/)\n2. Many projects are interested in having an embedded chat in their dApp,\n3. There are complex applications that need Waku as a solution. Taking RAILGUN as an example:\n  - Web wallet\n  - \\+ React Native mobile wallet\n  - \\+ NodeJS node/backend.\n\n(1) means that it is not that easy to create SDKs for common use cases.\n\n(2) was a clear candidate for an SDK. Yet, building a chat app is a complex task. Hence, the Status app team tackled\nthis in the form of [Status Web](https://github.com/status-im/status-web/).\n\nFinally, (3) was the most important lesson. We learned that multi-tier applications need Waku for decentralized and\ncensorship-resistant communications. For these projects, js-waku is simply not enough. They need Waku to work in their\nGolang backend, Unity desktop game and React Native mobile app.\n\nWe understood that we should see the whole Waku software suite\n([js-waku](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku),\n[nwaku](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku),\n[go-waku](https://github.com/status-im/go-waku),\n[waku-react-native](https://github.com/waku-org/waku-react-native),\n[etc](https://github.com/waku-org)) as an asset for its success.\nThat we should not limit outreach, marketing, documentation efforts to the web, but target all platforms.\n\nFrom a market perspective, we identified several actors:\n\n- platforms: Projects that uses Waku to handle communication,\n- operators: Operators run Waku nodes and are incentivized to do so,\n- developers: Developers are usually part of a platforms or solo hackers learning Web3,\n- contributors: Developers and researchers with interests in decentralization, privacy, censorship-resistance,\n  zero-knowledge, etc.\n\n# Waku for All Decentralized Applications and Infrastructures\n\nIn 2022, we shifted our focus to make the various Waku implementations **usable and used**.\n\nWe made Waku [multi-plaform](https://github.com/status-im/go-waku/tree/master/examples).\n\nWe shifted Waku positioning to leverage all Waku implementations and better serve the user's needs:\n\n- Running a node for your projects and want to use Waku? Use [nwaku](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku).\n- Going mobile? Use [Waku React Native](https://github.com/status-im/waku-react-native).\n- C++ Desktop Game? Use [go-waku's C-Bindings](https://github.com/status-im/go-waku/tree/master/examples/c-bindings).\n- Web app? Use [js-waku](https://github.com/status-im/js-waku).\n\nWe are consolidating the documentation for all implementations on a single website ([work in progress](https://github.com/waku-org/waku.org/issues/15))\nto improve developer experience.\n\nThis year, we also started the _operator outreach_ effort to push for users to run their own Waku nodes. We have\nrecently concluded our [first operator trial run](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku/issues/828).\n[Nwaku](https://vac.dev/introducing-nwaku)'s documentation, stability and performance has improved. It is now easier to\nrun your [own Waku node](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku/tree/master/docs/operators).\n\nToday, operator wannabes most likely run their own nodes to support or use the Waku network.\nWe are [dogfooding](https://twitter.com/oskarth/status/1582027828295790593?s=20&t=DPEP6fXK6KWbBjV5EBCBMA)\n[Waku RLN](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku/issues/827), our novel economic spam protection protocol,\nand looking at [incentivizing the Waku Store protocol](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/99).\nThis way, we are adding reasons to run your own Waku node.\n\nFor those who were following us in 2021, know that we are retiring the _Waku Connect_ branding in favour of the _Waku_\nbranding.\n\n# Waku for Your Project\n\nAs discussed, Waku is now available on various platforms. The question remains: How can Waku benefit **your** project?\n\nHere are a couple of use cases we recently investigated:\n\n## Layer-2 Decentralization\n\nMost ([[2] [3]](#references) roll-ups use a centralized sequencer or equivalent. Running several sequencers is not as straightforward as running several execution nodes.\nWaku can help:\n\n- Provide a neutral marketplace for a mempool: If sequencers compete for L2 tx fees, they may not be incentivized to\n  share transactions with other sequencers. Waku nodes can act as a neutral network to enable all sequences to access\n  transactions.\n- Enable censorship-resistant wallet<>L2 communication,\n- Provide rate limiting mechanism for spam protection: Using [RLN](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/32/) to prevent DDOS.\n\n## Device pairing and communication\n\nWith [Waku Device Pairing](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/43/), a user can setup a secure encrypted communication channel\nbetween their devices. As this channel would operate over Waku, it would be censorship-resistant and privacy preserving.\nThese two devices could be:\n\n- Ethereum node and mobile phone to access a remote admin panel,\n- Alice's phone and Bob's phone for any kind of secure communication,\n- Mobile wallet and desktop/browser dApp for transaction and signature exchange.\n\nCheck [js-waku#950](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku/issues/950) for the latest update on this. \n\n# Get Involved\n\nDeveloper?
