Custodians of protocols that reflect [a set of principles](/principles).\n\n## Our Principles\n\nLiberty, censorship resistance, security, privacy, transparency, openness, decentralization, inclusivity, continuance, resourcefulness.\n\nThese principles act as tools. Tools for thinking, for communication, and for decentralized decision making. They keep us honest about where we are failing short of our vision.\n\nThe meaning of these principles are elaboarted on [here](/principles).\n\n## Projects\n\n**Secure Messaging**. We design modular, p2p protocols for private, anonymous, secure and censorship-resistant communications. The main focus is [Waku](https://waku.org), the communication layer for Web3.\n\n**zk-WASM**. Research into making private and provable computation using WASM that is verified using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\n**RAD - RFCs & Dissemination**. We build [specifications](https://rfc.vac.dev) for self-sustainable robust protocols with strong and modular privacy guarantees. [Rough consensus and running code](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/). We also write papers and collaborate closely with other projects/institutions, and aim to build a bridge between industry and academia.\n\n**Applied ZK & Explorations**. We build tools to enable new fundamental building blocks using cutting-edge zero-knowledge proof systems. For example, [Zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit/).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Publications](/publications)\n- [Specs/RFCs](https://rfc.vac.dev)\n- [Forum](https://forum.vac.dev)\n","metadata":{"title":"Main"},"toc":[{"content":"Vac - Communication & Privacy","slug":"vac-communication-privacy","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"About Vac","slug":"about-vac","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Our Principles","slug":"our-principles","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"Projects","slug":"projects","lvl":2,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Links","slug":"links","lvl":2,"i":4,"seen":0}]},"navProps":{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Main"},"navOrder":1679052218.095,"localPath":"vac.md","path":[],"children":[],"isDir":false},"routeParams":{}},"__N_SSG":true}
