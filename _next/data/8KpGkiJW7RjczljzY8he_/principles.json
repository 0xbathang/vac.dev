{"pageProps":{"markdown":{"content":"*These principles have been inherited from https://our.status.im/our-principles/\nOnly minor stylistic changes have been made to them.*\n\n# Principles\n\nThe goal of Vac is widespread adoption of the decentralized web.\nOur challenge is achieving mass adoption while staying true to our principles outlined below.\n\n## I. Liberty\n\nWe believe in the sovereignty of individuals.\nAs a research organization that stands for the cause of personal liberty,\nwe aim to maximize social, political, and economic freedoms.\nThis includes being coercion-resistant.\n\n## II. Censorship resistance\n\nWe enable free flow of information.\nNo content is under surveillance.\nWe abide by the cryptoeconomic design principle of censorship resistance.\nEven stronger, we design agnostic infrastructures for information.\n\n## III. Security\n\nWe don't compromise on security when building features.\nWe use state-of-the-art technologies,\nand research new security methods and technologies to make strong security guarantees.\n\n## IV. Privacy\n\nPrivacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.\nFor us, it's essential to protect privacy in both communications and transactions,\nas well as pseudo-anonymity.\nAdditionally, we strive to provide the right of total anonymity.\n\n## V. Transparency\n\nWe strive for complete openness and symmetry of information within the organization,\nand have no border between our core contributors and our community.\nWe are frank about our shortcomings,\nespecially when making short-term tradeoffs in service of our long-term goals.\n\n## VI. Openness\n\nThe software we create is a public good.\nIt is made available via a free and open source license,\nfor anyone to share, modify and benefit from.\nWe believe in permission-less participation.\n\n## VII. Decentralization\n\nWe minimize centralization across both the software and the organization itself.\nIn other words, we maximize the number of physical computers composing the network,\nand maximize the number of individuals who have control over the system(s) we are building.\n\n## VIII. Inclusivity\n\nWe believe in fair and widespread access to our software, with an emphasis on ease-of-use.\nThis also extends to social inclusivity, permissionless participation, interoperability,\nand investing in educational efforts.\n\n## IX. Continuance\n\nWe create software incentivized to continue to exist and improve,\nwithout the stewardship of a single entity or any of the current team members.\n\n## X. Resourcefulness\n\nWe are relentlessly resourceful.\nAs we grow and have ready access to capital,\nit is our obligation to token holders to fight bureaucracy and inefficiencies within the organization.\nThis means solving problems in the most effective way possible at lower economic costs\n(in terms of capital, time and resources).\n","metadata":{},"toc":[{"content":"Principles","slug":"principles","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"I.
